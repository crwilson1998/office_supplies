# Office Supplies
This repository holds my office supply finder data pipeline

# Purpose
After my first data pipeline, I decided to make one I can actually use for when I am ready to setup my own home office and to further reinforce my knowledge on ETL. This time I used webscraping to gather the information

# Tools used
Python was used for the code base
BeautifulSoup to webscrape the the site
Re to match the pattern for the item I am looking for
Email.mime to send the results to my email
Airflow to handle the scheduling 
Pandas to export the results into separate dataframe then csv file
